1.1 About version control:
	Local version control: RCS
	central version control (collaborate with others): do with a server, high risk if goes down
	Distributed version control (lower risk): to save fully same one on each local and server

1.2 Short history about Git:
	From the development of Linux (open resource, thousands of branched)

	Other VCS think of information as different file (like we usually do)
	Git think of information as snapshot (the whole picture of all information), save them, and link
		This make git reconsider all aspect of information when version changes

	Git store hash value look like ‘24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373’ for check

	The three stage: local , staging (marked as snapshot), commited (to database)
