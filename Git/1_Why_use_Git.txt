Why should I use version control?

Have you ever:
	•	Made a change to code, realised it was a mistake and wanted to revert back?
	•	Lost code or had a backup that was too old?
	•	Had to maintain multiple versions of a product?
	•	Wanted to see the difference between two (or more) versions of your code?
	•	Wanted to prove that a particular change broke or fixed a piece of code?
	•	Wanted to review the history of some code?
	•	Wanted to submit a change to someone else's code?
	•	Wanted to share your code, or let other people work on your code?
	•	Wanted to see how much work is being done, and where, when and by whom?
	•	Wanted to experiment with a new feature without interfering with working code?
In these cases, and no doubt others, a version control system should make your life easier.
